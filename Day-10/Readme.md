**Policy as Code**

Policy is a rule => for the purpose security and compliance.

For a user, we are assigning particular roles, like only view the servers, (IAM Policy)

With ansible, we can implement the policy as code.

Password less authentication is not required untill we are contacting to a server or vm..
